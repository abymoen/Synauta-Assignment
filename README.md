# Synauta-Assignment
Small coding assignment for Synauta evaluation

I very much regret using file as input. I should have stuck to Scanner. Whoops.
The real logic of moving the robot can be found in Simulation.java, in the few methods above the getters and setters.
Most of the lines are overkill / dealing with parsing of input.
I didn't know exactly how far you wanted me to go for input checking, so I just checked what I assumed was reasonable.
